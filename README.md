# Carp talks

A collection of talks Iâ€™ve given or will be giving on Carp.

Some time this year I moved from [`mdp`](https://github.com/visit1985/mdp) to
Beamer, which means that the earliest talk is still written in `mdp`-friendly
Markdown, whereas the later talks require Latex (you can also look at the
generated PDF I checked in instead). A Makefile is attached.
