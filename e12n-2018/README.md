# EnthusiastiCon 2018

I’ve given a talk on Carp at EnthusiastiCon 2018. You can look at
[the proposal](https://github.com/hellerve/e12n-proposal) or the
[slides](https://github.com/hellerve/carp-intro).

In an early misguided attempt at open-sourcing my talks process I’ve moved
everything into its own repository, which was a bad idea. Won’t be doing that
again.
