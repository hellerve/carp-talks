# clojuTRE 2018

I gave a 20 minute presentation on Carp at clojuTRE 2018. These are the slides
and materials.

The talk was recorded and the recording was uploaded [to Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BQeG6fXMk28).
Many thanks to [Metosin](https://www.metosin.fi/en/) for organizing the
conference and having me! Youâ€™re great!
