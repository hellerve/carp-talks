# Carp: A Language for the 21st century—Abstract

The last few years have been exciting for programming languages enthusiasts.
Rust freed us from the chains of garbage collection. Functional languages such
as Haskell, Idris, and Agda have given us expressive type systems. Lisps come
back into the mainstream consciousness, and they are bringing macros. In my
talk “Carp: A Language for the 21st century” I want to introduce you to an
exciting new programming language that aims to unify multiple branches of this
development. Carp is a Lisp that combines macros, a modern type system, and an
adaption of the Rust borrow checker to get rid of garbage collection. We will
talk a bit about the ideas and concepts behind the language before diving into
a playful hands-on demo, with the aim of empowering the audience to start
working with Carp themselves. In a blatant disregard of conference best
practices, there will be live-coding! To get our feet back on the ground
afterwards, we will also take a brief and honest look at the state of the
language and ecosystem, and cover how you could get involved!
