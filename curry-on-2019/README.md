# Curry On 2019

I proposed a talk to Curry On 2019 in London, and it was accepted! You can only
look at [the abstract](./abstract.md) for now! This will be similar to the
one I gave at [Localhost](/localhost-oct-2018) in 2018, except that Carp has
evolved quite a bit since then, matured and grown and is much more presentable!
