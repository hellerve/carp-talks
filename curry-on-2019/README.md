# Curry On 2019

I proposed a talk to Curry On 2019 in London, and it was accepted! You can look
at [the abstract](./abstract.md), my [notes/transcript](transcript.md) or [the
slides](./talk.pdf).

It’s a bit different than the other talks I’ve given on Carp in that it doesn’t
so much introduce the language but explore the space for tooling in the Carp
workflow.
