# Carp: A Language for the 21st century

## Abstract

The last few years have been exciting for programming languages enthusiasts. Rust freed us from the chains of garbage collection. Functional languages such as Haskell, Idris, and Agda have given us expressive type systems. Lisps come back into the mainstream consciousness, and they are bringing macros. In my talk “Carp: A Language for the 21st century” I want to introduce you to an exciting new programming language that aims to unify multiple branches of this development. Carp is a Lisp that combines macros, a modern type system, and an adaption of the Rust borrow checker to get rid of garbage collection. We will talk a bit about the ideas and concepts behind the language before diving into a playful hands-on demo, with the aim of empowering the audience to start working with Carp themselves. In a blatant disregard of conference best practices, there will be live-coding! To get our feet back on the ground afterwards, we will also take a brief and honest look at the state of the language and ecosystem, and cover how you could get involved!

## What prior knowledge is required to understand this talk? 

basic programming knowledge; ability to read lisp is good, but by no means necessary

## Has this talk been presented at other conferences?

Yes (see [EnthusiastiCon 2018](/e12n-2018)).

## Bio

Veit is one of the core maintainers of Carp. As his day job, he is the CTO of Port Zero, a small consultancy based in Berlin. He does a lot of open source work and likes to build programs for domains he knows nothing about.

## Travel stuff

I’m not interested in funding, I’m coming from Berlin, I’m probably spending
around 1,000 CAD on this.
