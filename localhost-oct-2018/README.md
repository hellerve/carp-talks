# Localhost, Oct 23, 2018

Iâ€™ll be giving a talk on Carp at [Localhost](http://recurse.com/localhost), a
monthly series of talks organized by the [Recurse Center](http://recurse.com/).

It will be 30-40 minutes long, and probably be an extended version of my talk at
[clojuTRE 2018](/clojutre-2018) and the [Berlin Clojure
Meetup](/clojure-meetup-berlin-oct-2018).
